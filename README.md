### Corona Virus Case Tracker

This is just a fun little project to gain some more practice with Spring Boot. Through this project I was also able to gain some exposure to Thymeleaf and Bootstrap. The data source is "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv". The tutorial for this project is on youtube by Java Brains.
